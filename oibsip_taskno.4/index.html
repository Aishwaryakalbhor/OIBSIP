                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Kalpana Chawla completed her early education in Punjab.</strong><br>
                        After finishing school from Karnal, Kalpana pursued a course in aeronautical engineering at Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh. She moved to the United States in 1982 and obtained a Master of Science degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Texas. She then earned a doctorate in aerospace engineering from the University of Colorado.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>She became a naturalized US citizen in April 1991 and applied for the NASA Astronaut Corps.</strong><br>
                        Kalpana began working at the NASA Ames Research Center in 1988, and joined the Corps in March 1995 after becoming a naturalized US citizen.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>In 1997, she became the first Indian-born woman and the second Indian person to fly in space.</strong><br>
                        Her first flight was on Space Shuttle Columbia in 1997 as a mission specialist and primary robotic arm operator. The mission began on November 19, 1997, and Kalpana was a part of a six-astronaut crew.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Her second flight was also her last.</strong><br>
                        In 2000, Kalpana was selected for her second flight as a part of the crew of STS-107. The mission got repeatedly delayed and was finally launched in 2003. On February 1, 2003, the space shuttle disintegrated over Texas while trying to re-enter the Earthâ€™s atmosphere. Over the course of the 16-day flight, the crew completed more than 80 experiments.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>She was posthumously honoured with the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, NASA Space Flight Medal and NASA Distinguished Service Medal.</strong>    
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Kalpana Chawla logged 30 days, 14 hours, and 54 minutes in space over the course of her two missions.</strong>    
                    </li>
